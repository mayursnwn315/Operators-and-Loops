1.What are the Conditional Operators in Java?


Ans- Conditional operators in Java include == (equal to), != (not equal to), < (less than), > (greater than), <= (less than or equal to), and >= (greater than or equal to).


2.What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?


Ans- Operators can be classified into unary (1 operand), binary (2 operands), and ternary (3 operands) based on the number of operands they take.


3.What is the use of Switch case in Java programming?


Ans- The switch-case statement in Java is used for multi-branching based on the value of an expression. It allows the execution of one block of statements among many based on the value of the expression.


4.What are the priority levels of arithmetic operations in Java?


Ans- The priority levels of arithmetic operations in Java follow the order of operations: parentheses, multiplication/division, and addition/subtraction.


5.What are the Conditional Statements and types of conditional statements in Java?


Ans- Conditional statements in Java include if, if-else, and switch. They are used to control the flow of the program based on certain conditions.


6.What is the syntax of the if statement?


Ans- The syntax of the if statement in Java is:
java
Copy code
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
}


7.What are the 3 types of iterative statements in Java?


Ans- The three types of iterative statements in Java are for, while, and do-while loops.


8.Write the difference between for loop and do-while loop?


Ans-The primary difference between a for loop and a do-while loop is that a for loop checks the condition before executing the loop, while a do-while loop checks the condition after executing the loop at least once.


9.Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10.
Ans-
java
Copy code
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
